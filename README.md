# Employee Management System
 This program allows users to manage employee information by performing various operations such as inserting new employee records, searching for employees, deleting employees, and updating employee details. The user interface is designed using Java AWT components and includes text fields and buttons for data input and operations. The program connects to a MySQL database using JDBC to store and retrieve employee data.
